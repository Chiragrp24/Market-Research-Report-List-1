<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Plastic Tailgate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Tailgate</li><li>Thermoset Tailgate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive plastic tailgate market comprises two major types: thermoplastic tailgates and thermoset tailgates. A thermoplastic tailgate is made from a type of plastic that can be melted and remolded multiple times without losing its properties. This makes it highly durable and resistant to impact, making it a popular choice. On the other hand, a thermoset tailgate is made from a plastic that undergoes a chemical reaction during the manufacturing process, resulting in a rigid and hard material that cannot be melted or remolded. While less flexible, it offers excellent dimensional stability and heat resistance.</p></p>
