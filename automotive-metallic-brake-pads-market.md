<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Metallic Brake Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Metallic Brake Pads</li><li>Low Metallic NAO Brake Pads</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive metallic brake pads can be categorized into two types: semi metallic brake pads and low metallic NAO brake pads. Semi metallic brake pads contain a blend of metal fibers, such as steel or copper, combined with synthetic materials and fillers. These pads offer excellent performance in terms of stopping power, durability, and heat dissipation. On the other hand, low metallic NAO brake pads have a lower metal content, with more emphasis on organic materials like glass and rubber. They provide smoother braking, reduced noise and dust levels, and are generally more budget-friendly.</p></p>
