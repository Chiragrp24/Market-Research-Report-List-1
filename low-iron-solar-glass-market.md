<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Iron Solar Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low iron solar glass is a key component in the production of solar panels, designed to increase light transmittance and maximize energy efficiency. There are two main types of low iron solar glass: rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is manufactured by rolling molten glass into a flat sheet, making it thinner and more flexible. Float glass, on the other hand, is produced by floating molten glass on a bed of molten tin, resulting in a perfectly flat and smooth surface. Both types of low iron solar glass offer excellent optical properties for enhanced solar energy absorption.</p></p>
