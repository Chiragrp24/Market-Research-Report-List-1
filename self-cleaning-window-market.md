<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Window Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coating</li><li>Hydrophobic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning window market comprises two main types of coatings: hydrophilic coating and hydrophobic coating. Hydrophilic coating is designed to attract water, forming a thin film that spreads evenly on the glass surface. It enables rainwater to wash away dirt and grime, ensuring a self-cleaning effect. On the other hand, hydrophobic coating repels water, causing rain droplets to form into beads and roll off the window, carrying dirt particles away. Both types of coatings offer self-cleaning properties but work differently to keep windows clean and maintain clarity.</p></p>
