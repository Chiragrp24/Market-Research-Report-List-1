<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silt Fence Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Woven Fibres</li><li>Non-woven Fibres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The silt fence market can be classified into two types, woven fibres and non-woven fibres. Woven fibres refer to a type of silt fence made from interlaced threads, creating a strong and durable barrier. On the other hand, non-woven fibres are made from a random arrangement of fibers, providing a more flexible and permeable option. Both types of silt fences are designed to control erosion by capturing sediments and preventing their movement, but they differ in terms of their structure and functionality.</p></p>
