<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intensive Care Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Intensive care neonatal ventilators are medical devices used to provide respiratory support to critically ill newborn infants. There are two types of ventilators available in the market: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators involve the insertion of a breathing tube into the newborn's airway, while non-invasive ventilators deliver oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs. Both types help deliver a controlled amount of oxygen and support the infant's breathing, but the choice between invasive and non-invasive ventilation depends on the specific needs and condition of the newborn.</p></p>
