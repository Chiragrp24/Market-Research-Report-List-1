<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Chassis Dyno Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi Roller</li><li>Single Roller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle chassis dyno market comprises two types: multi-roller and single-roller dynos. Multi-roller dynos feature multiple rollers that connect to the vehicle's wheels, allowing each wheel to be tested individually. This provides a more accurate measurement of the vehicle's performance and enables assessment of its individual wheel behavior. On the other hand, single-roller dynos utilize only a single roller connected to two of the vehicle's wheels, usually the front or rear. While less accurate than multi-roller dynos, single-roller dynos are commonly used for general performance assessments and tuning purposes.</p></p>
