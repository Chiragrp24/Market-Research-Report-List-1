<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-Rigid Foams Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Elastic Modulus</li><li>High Elastic Modulus</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Semi-rigid foams are categorized into two market types based on their elastic modulus, which measures the stiffness or flexibility of a material. Low elastic modulus semi-rigid foams have a lower stiffness, making them more flexible and easier to compress. They are commonly used in applications that require cushioning or shock absorption, such as packaging materials or bedding products. In contrast, high elastic modulus semi-rigid foams have a higher stiffness, making them suitable for applications that require structural support and stability, such as insulation panels or construction materials.</p></p>
