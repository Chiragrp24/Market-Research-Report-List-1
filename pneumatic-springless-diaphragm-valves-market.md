<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Springless Diaphragm Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-port Valves</li><li>3-port Valves</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pneumatic springless diaphragm valves market comprises two main types, namely 2-port valves and 3-port valves. 2-port valves are designed with two ports, an inlet, and an outlet, allowing for a simple "on-off" or "open-closed" control. On the other hand, 3-port valves possess three ports, typically an inlet and two outlets or vice versa, enabling the diversion of flow to different directions. Both types of valves operate without the need for a spring and utilize a flexible diaphragm to control the flow of fluids or gases.</p></p>
