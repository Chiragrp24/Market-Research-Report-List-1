<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Charger</li><li>AC Charger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty electric vehicle charging infrastructure market encompasses two main types: DC chargers and AC chargers. DC chargers, also known as fast chargers, can provide high-power charging to electric vehicles, enabling quick recharge times. They typically require a more robust and expensive infrastructure due to the high voltages involved. In contrast, AC chargers operate at lower voltages and are more common, found in homes, workplaces, and public parking facilities. While they provide slower charging speeds, they are cheaper to install and require less maintenance.</p></p>
