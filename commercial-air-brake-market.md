<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Air Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Disc Brake</li><li>Air Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial air brake market consists of two main types: air disc brake and air drum brake. Air disc brakes are a type of braking system where a rotating disc is squeezed by a caliper to slow down or stop the vehicle. These brakes offer improved performance and shorter stopping distances, making them popular in heavy-duty trucks and trailers. On the other hand, air drum brakes use a pair of brake shoes that press against a rotating drum to generate friction and slow down the vehicle. They are commonly found in commercial vehicles due to their durability and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
