<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam</li><li>Double Beam</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrometer (UV-Vis) market consists of two types, namely single beam and double beam spectrometers. Single beam spectrometers are simpler and less expensive, as they utilize a single beam of light to measure the absorption of samples and a reference simultaneously. In contrast, double beam spectrometers split the light beam into two paths, one for the sample and the other for the reference. This allows for continuous comparison, compensating for potential fluctuations in the light source, providing more accurate readings.</p></p>
