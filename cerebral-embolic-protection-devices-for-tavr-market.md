<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebral Embolic Protection Devices for TAVR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Total Artery Coverage</li><li>Non-total Artery Coverage</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cerebral embolic protection devices are used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures to prevent the occurrence of strokes by capturing debris that may break loose during the procedure and travel to the brain. Total artery coverage devices provide complete coverage of the arteries leading to the brain, ensuring maximum protection. Non-total artery coverage devices offer partial coverage, protecting only specific arteries. Both types aim to minimize the potential risk of embolic events during TAVR procedures, safeguarding patients from stroke complications.</p></p>
