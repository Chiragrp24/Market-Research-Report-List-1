<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulated Rail Joints (IRJ) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Supported IRJs</li><li>Suspended IRJs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) are crucial components in railway tracks that help electrically isolate sections of the track to maintain safe and reliable operations. There are two main types of IRJs: Supported IRJs and Suspended IRJs. Supported IRJs are fixed directly onto the sleepers or ballast, providing structural support and electrical insulation. On the other hand, Suspended IRJs are hung from overhead structures, such as bridges or tunnels, to allow for thermal expansion and contraction. Both types play a vital role in maintaining track integrity and electrical isolation in railway networks.</p></p>
