<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer</li><li>Surfactant</li><li>ASP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is a method used to extract more oil from reservoirs by injecting chemicals into the reservoir. Polymer EOR involves injecting polymer solutions to increase the viscosity of water and displace oil. Surfactant EOR utilizes surfactants to lower the interfacial tension between water and oil, facilitating easier oil flow. Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) EOR combines the use of polymer, surfactant, and alkali to improve oil recovery. These methods enhance the reservoir sweep efficiency and improve oil displacement, resulting in increased oil production.</p></p>
