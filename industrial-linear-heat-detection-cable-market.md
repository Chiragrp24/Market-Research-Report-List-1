<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Linear Heat Detection Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital</li><li>Analogue</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Industrial Linear Heat Detection Cable Market consists of two main types: Digital and Analogue. </p><p>Digital Linear Heat Detection Cable operates on a binary system, where it detects and transmits temperature changes as either "on" or "off" signals. This type offers precise operation and allows for quick and accurate identification of heat or fire incidents.</p><p>On the other hand, Analogue Linear Heat Detection Cable provides continuous monitoring of temperature fluctuations and offers a range of temperature readings. It provides more detailed and flexible information about the heat source, allowing for better control and customization of fire detection and suppression systems.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Industrial Linear Heat Detection Cable Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Below 80 °C</li><li>80-100 °C</li><li>Above 100 °C</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial linear heat detection cable market application can be categorized into three segments based on temperature ranges. Below 80 °C refers to environments where the cable is able to detect heat and raise an alarm at temperatures lower than 80 °C. 80-100 °C indicates that the cable can detect heat and give an alarm when the temperature falls within this range. Above 100 °C means that the cable can detect heat and raise an alarm for temperatures exceeding 100 °C. These temperature segments help tailor the application of linear heat detection cables to various industrial scenarios.</p></p>
