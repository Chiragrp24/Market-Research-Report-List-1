<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Architectural Float Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clear Float Glass</li><li>Extra Clear Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Architectural float glass refers to a type of glass that is made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal, typically tin. It is widely used in construction and architecture due to its transparency and strength. There are two main types of architectural float glass: clear float glass and extra clear float glass. Clear float glass has a slight green tint and is commonly used in applications where high light transmission is desired. Extra clear float glass, on the other hand, has reduced iron content and offers superior clarity, making it ideal for applications that require maximum transparency.</p></p>
