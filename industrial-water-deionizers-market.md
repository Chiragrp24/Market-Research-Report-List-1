<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Water Deionizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-bed Deionization</li><li>Mixed-bed Deionization</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial Water Deionizers are used in various processes to remove impurities from water. Two-bed Deionization involves the use of two separate resin beds, one containing cation exchange resin and the other anion exchange resin, to remove positively and negatively charged ions respectively. This type is suitable for applications where high levels of purity are not required. On the other hand, Mixed-bed Deionization combines the cation and anion exchange resins in a single resin bed, resulting in a higher level of purity by removing both types of ions simultaneously. It is used for applications that require ultra-pure water.</p></p>
