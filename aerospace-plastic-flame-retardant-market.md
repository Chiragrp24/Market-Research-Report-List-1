<p><p>The aerospace plastic flame retardant market consists of different types of flame retardant materials used in aerospace plastics to prevent the spread of fire. These types include antimony oxide, aluminum trihydrate, organophosphates/phosphorous, and boron compounds. Antimony oxide works by releasing gases that inhibit the combustion process, while aluminum trihydrate releases water vapor to cool the flame. Organophosphates/phosphorous compounds act as barrier coatings, preventing the access of oxygen to the plastic. Boron compounds release water vapor and form a protective layer to suppress fire.</p></p>
