<p><strong>The Self-Leveling Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Underlayment</li><li>Toppings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Self-leveling concrete is a type of flooring material that is designed to provide a smooth and level surface. It is commonly used in two main market types: underlayment and toppings. Underlayment self-leveling concrete is typically used as a base layer to provide a level and even surface for other types of flooring, such as tiles or hardwood. On the other hand, topping self-leveling concrete is used as a final layer to enhance the appearance and durability of the floor. Both types offer easy application, quick drying times, and high compressive strength.</p></p>
