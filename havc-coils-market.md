<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HAVC Coils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporator Coils</li><li>Condenser Coils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HAVC coils market consists of two main types: evaporator coils and condenser coils. Evaporator coils are an essential component of air conditioning systems as they remove heat and humidity from indoor air. They work by evaporating refrigerant to cool the air circulating in the system. On the other hand, condenser coils are responsible for releasing the heat absorbed by the refrigerant to the outside environment, allowing for the cooling process to occur. Both types of coils play a crucial role in the overall efficiency and functioning of HVAC systems.</p></p>
