<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVDF Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic</li><li>Hydrophilic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PVDF membrane is used in various applications, and it comes in two types: hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic membranes repel water and are commonly used in filtration processes where it is necessary to separate fluids from non-aqueous solutions. On the other hand, hydrophilic membranes attract water and are ideal for applications where the fluid to be filtered is water-based. Both types of membranes offer distinct advantages based on their ability to either repel or attract water, making them suitable for different applications and industries.</p></p>
