<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Shock Absorber Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Rubber</li><li>Chloroprene Rubber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive shock absorber rubber market consists of two main types: natural rubber and chloroprene rubber. Natural rubber is derived from the sap of rubber trees and offers excellent elasticity, tear resistance, and low heat buildup. It is widely used in automotive shock absorbers due to its durability and flexibility. On the other hand, chloroprene rubber is a synthetic rubber with similar properties to natural rubber but has better resistance to factors like oil, heat, and ozone. This makes chloroprene rubber suitable for harsh automotive environments.</p></p>
