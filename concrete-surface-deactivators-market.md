<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Surface Deactivators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Agents</li><li>Inorganic Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concrete surface deactivators market types can be broadly categorized into organic agents and inorganic agents. Organic agents, typically derived from plant or animal sources, work by chemically reacting with the concrete surface to prevent it from setting and hardening uniformly. In contrast, inorganic agents are usually based on acids or salts, which dissolve the cement on the surface and expose the aggregates underneath. Both types of deactivators offer unique advantages depending on the desired outcome, such as achieving a weathered or exposed aggregate finish in architectural concrete applications.</p></p>
