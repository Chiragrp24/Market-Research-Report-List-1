<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Cranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stiff Boom Cranes</li><li>Folding Boom Cranes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wind cranes are classified into two main types - stiff boom cranes and folding boom cranes. Stiff boom cranes are characterized by their rigid, fixed boom that remains in a straight position at all times. This type of crane is commonly used in applications where a long reach and precise lifting is required. On the other hand, folding boom cranes have a hinged boom that can be folded or unfolded as needed. This flexibility allows them to be easily transported and stored, making them ideal for wind turbine installation projects.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Wind Cranes Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Onshore</li><li>Offshore</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wind cranes are commonly used in both onshore and offshore settings. In onshore wind farms, these cranes play a crucial role in the installation and maintenance of wind turbines. They are responsible for lifting and positioning heavy components, such as turbine blades and nacelles. Similarly, in offshore wind farms, wind cranes are used to transport and assemble turbine components on fixed or floating structures at sea. The market for wind cranes is driven by the growing demand for renewable energy and the increasing installation of wind farms, both onshore and offshore.</p></p>
