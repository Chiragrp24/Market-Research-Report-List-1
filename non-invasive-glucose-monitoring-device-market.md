<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Glucose Monitoring Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wearable Devices</li><li>Non-wearable Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive glucose monitoring device market consists of two major types: wearable devices and non-wearable devices. Wearable devices are worn on the body, often as a watch or a patch, and use sensors to measure glucose levels in the blood without the need for pricking the skin. Non-wearable devices, on the other hand, are typically handheld devices that also use sensors to monitor glucose levels, but do not need to be worn on the body. Both types offer a convenient and painless alternative to traditional invasive methods of glucose monitoring.</p></p>
