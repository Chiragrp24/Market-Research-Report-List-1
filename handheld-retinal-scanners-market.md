<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Retinal Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No Mydriasis</li><li>Mydriasis</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Handheld retinal scanners are medical devices used for non-invasive examination of the retina, providing valuable information for diagnosing and monitoring various eye conditions. There are two types of handheld retinal scanners based on pupil dilation: those that do not require mydriasis and those that do. No mydriasis scanners utilize advanced imaging technologies that allow examination of the retina without the need for dilating eye drops. Conversely, mydriasis scanners require the use of eye drops to enlarge the pupil, enabling a more detailed examination of the retina and its blood vessels.</p></p>
