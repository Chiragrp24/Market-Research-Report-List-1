<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Intelligent Headlight Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adaptive Front-lighting System</li><li>Adaptive Driving Beam System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Intelligent Headlight Market includes two types of systems: the Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) and the Adaptive Driving Beam System (ADB). AFS allows the headlights to adapt their beam pattern according to the vehicle's speed, steering angle, and driving conditions. This ensures optimal illumination and enhances visibility while driving. On the other hand, ADB goes a step further by dynamically adjusting the beam pattern in real-time to avoid dazzling oncoming drivers, while still providing maximum visibility for the driver. Both systems improve safety and driving experience by enabling intelligent control of the headlights.</p></p>
