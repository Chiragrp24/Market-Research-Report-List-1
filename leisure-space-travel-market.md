<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The leisure space travel market has experienced significant growth over the past decade with several players emerging to offer extraordinary experiences beyond Earth's atmosphere. Some of the key players in this market include Space Adventures, EADS Astrium, Virgin Galactic, Armadillo Aerospace, Excalibur Almaz, Space Island Group, SpaceX, Boeing, and Zero 2 Infinity.</p><p>Virgin Galactic, founded by British business tycoon Richard Branson, has been a major player in the leisure space travel industry. The company was founded in 2004 and aims to make space travel accessible to the general public. Virgin Galactic's most notable project is the development of its VSS Unity spacecraft. The company has had several successful test flights, with plans to start commercial operations in the near future. The market growth for Virgin Galactic has been promising, with a steady increase in bookings and investments from individuals and organizations looking to explore space.</p><p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has been at the forefront of the commercial space industry. Unlike its competitors, SpaceX focuses more on commercial space transportation and payload delivery rather than solely leisure travel. The company has achieved numerous milestones, including being the first privately funded company to launch a spacecraft into orbit. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft have gained significant traction in the industry, attracting clients such as NASA and other private space companies. The market growth for SpaceX has been remarkable, with the company's reusable rocket technology and lower launch costs challenging traditional players like Boeing.</p><p>Boeing, a well-established aerospace company, also has a presence in the leisure space travel market. Boeing offers its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, designed to transport crew and cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). The company has secured contracts with NASA for crewed missions to the ISS, making it a significant player in the commercial space market. Although Boeing's focus is primarily on space exploration and transportation, it could potentially enter the leisure space travel market in the future. The market size for Boeing in the leisure space travel sector is yet to be determined, as the company's main revenue stream lies in other aerospace ventures.</p><p>Unfortunately, specific sales revenue for the listed companies is not readily available. However, it is worth noting that the overall market for leisure space travel is projected to reach significant values in the coming years, with estimates ranging from billions to trillions of dollars. The increasing interest from wealthy individuals, businesses, and governments in exploring space has fueled this market's growth. As the industry continues to evolve and new players emerge, it is expected that the market size and revenue generated by these companies will increase substantially.</p></p>
