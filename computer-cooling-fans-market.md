<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computer Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The computer cooling fans market comprises two types of fans: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans are the most common type and are characterized by their propeller-like blades that draw air in parallel to the axis of rotation. They are effective at moving large volumes of air, making them suitable for cooling desktop computers or servers. On the other hand, centrifugal fans have curved blades that draw air in perpendicular to the axis of rotation. They are capable of generating higher pressure, making them ideal for cooling components with restricted airflow, such as graphics cards or laptops.</p></p>
